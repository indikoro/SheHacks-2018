# Feelnotes Web App

If you've learned to let things go and have a hard time remembering your days, Feelnotes intends to remember for you. In the full version, Feelnotes will use your journal entries and imported activites from things such as Fitbit, Google Calendar, etc. to track your moods and take notes on what makes you happy. All in a minimal, pastel-toned web app that just might boost your mood a little on its own.
